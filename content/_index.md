I have been playing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for 18 years now and it is one of my favourite games of all times. I like to think that I know everything about this game, but the truth is I don't. There are many things that the game does not tell us, this is an excellent reason to play the game again and again (and read some <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic">StrategyWiki</a>).
