<h2 class="title">Description</h2>

<div class="block">
  While the first KOTOR sometimes feels like it is meant to be played with a lightsaber, KOTOR II
  offers new feats and upgrades that make blaster rifles and pistol even more lethal.
  With the right upgrades your dps is **insane**, sometimes making you able to one shot the hardest ennemies
  (such as trandoshans on Nar Shadda). I love this build.
</div>

<div class="block">
  The begining of the game won't be easy. All dro√Øds on Peragus II use shields so it is almost
  impossible to dammage them with low tier blasters. You should use a vibroblade, even if you have Strength 8,
  resulting in a penalty of -1 attack and -1 dammage. Fortunately, the Jedi Guardian still have a high attack.
</div>

<div class="block">
  Now let's talk about feats, skills and powers:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Feats</strong> will focus on Two-Weapon Fighting, Precise Shot, and Weapon Specialization: Blasters.</li>
    <li>1 <strong>Skill point</strong> in <strong>Security</strong> (resulting in 1 + 2 INT = 3 ) makes you able to open
    all doors and containers in Peragus II, except one in the Harbinger (the room in front of your private quarters.)</li>
    <li>Almost every powers are useless for this build, especially if you play with an armor. Good news is: you can rely on Kreia to buff yourself with powers that you can't cast because of the armor (Knight Speed, Knight Valor...).</li>
    <li>You won't be able to repair HK-47 or T3-M4. Breaking down items won't give you much components, but you can cheat
    using the infinite Jedi robe glitch thanks to the handmaiden.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="title is-4">What I would have change</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Class Skill: Repair instead of Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistol.</li>
  <li>Level 7: Improved Rapid Shot instead of Weapon Specialization: Blaster Pistol.</li>
</ul>
