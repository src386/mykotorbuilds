<h2 class="title">Description</h2>

<div class="block">I always though ranged weapon sucked in KOTOR because they do not get damage bonuses from Dexterity unlike melee weapon with Strengh. Turns out I was wrong and it is one of my favourites build right now. </div>

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body">
    <strong>Note:</strong> this is a RP build. I will "waste" attributes points into Intelligence and Charisma for Roleplay purposes and skills to unlock dialogues and repair HK-47. Don't worry, it's fun to play and you will do lots of dammage.
  </div>
</article>

<div class="block">Don't be afraid to leave the Strength attribute at 8, because we'll <u>never</u> use any melee weapon nor any lightsaber, so it's totally useless. Those 2 points will be invested in Wisdom that will help the Awareness skill and give more force points boost).</div>

<div class="block">You will use <em>Zaalbar's Bowcaster</em> on Taris then buy <em>Jamoh Hogra's Carbine</em> on Tatooine and finally switch to the <em>Baragwin Assault Gun</em> at the end of the game. Alternatively if you want to switch to a dual welded build, you can buy Cassus <em>Fett's Heavy Pistol</em> + <em>Mandalorian Heavy Pistol</em>.
</div>

<div class="block">Now let's talk about my "RP" or "completionist" requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>Free the mandalorian prisoner on Korriban (light side): <strong>Computer Use 5-7</strong> (or 1-3 + 4 INT with Master Valor) for a <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Sith_Academy#Mandalorian_Weapons_Cache">25% chance of sucess</a>.</li>
    <li>HK-47: <strong>Repair 17</strong> (or 13 +4 INT with Master Valor]) to <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/HK-47#Repairs">unlock bonuses</a> and dialogues.</li>
    <li><strong>Persuasion</strong> >= 13 (or 11 + 2 CHA) for a <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Skills#Persuade">25% chance of success</a> on hard speech checks.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="title is-4">Non-Jedi class</h3>

<div class="block">
Here were my options:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Soldier</strong> has difficult skill progression. It is not possible to unlock all Persuade dialogs on Taris and it's not possible to fully repair HK-47.</li>
  <li>I choosed <strong>Scout</strong> because it has 6 interesting feats for free (Rapid Shot tree + Implants tree), a balanced +8 HP/level, 3 + [INT/2] skills points per level, with <em>Repair</em> and <em>Computer Use</em> as class skills (unfortunately, <em>Persuade</em> is not).</li>
  <li><strong>Scoundrel</strong> has a quick skill progression and gets huge bonuses from Sneak attack. However, Taris is much more difficult, and Repair is a cross class skill (unless you go Consular). So I'll stick with the Scout.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="title is-4">Jedi class</h3>

<div class="block">
Since I want to rely only on blaster and no light sabers or offensive powers, all Jedi classes fit:
<ul>
  <li>Jedi <strong>Guardian</strong> has lots of HP, many feats, and force jump. I do not really need any of these. However they get a huge attack bonus, but because the build is focused on Dexterity, it's not that usefull.</li>

  <li>Jedi <strong>Sentinel</strong> has moderate HP and force points, many skills and immunity vs Stun/Fear/paralize. I thinks it's a good choice, especially against dark jedi who spams the "Fear" power.</li>

  <li>Jedi <strong>Consular</strong> has low HP but many force points and extra force power. Might be a good choice if you wand to mix blasters with offensive force power, but I don't. I also think that Consulars sucks unless you wait for the end of the game when high tier powers get available.</li>
</ul>

  </ol>
</div>

<h3 class="title is-4">Gameplay</h3>

<div class="block">First, it is important to stay out of melee range, but not too far away. <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Combat#Ranged">Close Combat</a> is a hidden mechanic that gives you +10 attack, however Melee attacker gets also +10 on ranged. You should use a companion to tank ennemies, for this I don't see a better candidate than Canderous.</div>

<div class="block">Recover all mines, they are very usefull against though bosses or mini bosses. You can kill the two Terentateks on Korriban with mines which is really badass. You can also trivialize the final fight against Malak.</div>

<div class="block">Finally, don't forget to cast your main powers at the begining of each battle: <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Force_Valor">Master Valor</a>, <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Burst_of_Speed">Master Speed</a>, and <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Energy_Resistance">Improved Energy Resistance</a> if necessary (very usefull for close combat with dark jedis).</div>
