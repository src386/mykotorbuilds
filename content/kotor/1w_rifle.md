<h2 class="title">Description</h2>

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body">
    <strong>Note:</strong> this is a RP build that "wastes" attributes points into Intelligence and Charisma for Roleplay purposes and skills to unlock dialogues and repair HK-47. Don't worry, it's fun to play and you will do lots of dammage.
  </div>
</article>

<div class="block">Don't be afraid to leave the Strength attribute at 8, because we'll <u>never</u> use any melee weapon nor any lightsaber, so it's totally useless. Those 2 points will be invested in Wisdom that will help the Awareness skill and give more force points boost).</div>

<div class="block">It is important to stay out of melee range, but not too far away. <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Combat#Ranged">Close Combat</a> is a hidden mechanism that gives +10 attack (beware this also gives +10 to the melee attacker). You should use a companion to tank ennemies, for this role I can't see a better candidate than Canderous.</div>

<div class="block">Recover all mines, they are very usefull against though bosses or mini bosses. You can trivialize some boss fights if you are able to set plenty of mines, although it is not necessary because this build is powerfull. For example, I have defeated Malak 9 times on the Star forge, I let him regenerate himself for more humiliation.</div>

<div class="block">Finally, don't forget to heavily rely on <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Burst_of_Speed">Master Speed</a> and <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Feats#Rapid_Shot">Master Rapid Shot</a> allowing for an insane dammage output. You should also use <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Energy_Resistance">Improved Energy Resistance</a> against dark jedis, they won't be able to damage you at all. <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/Force_powers#Force_Valor">Master Valor</a> is also a must have, but it might take too long time to cast 3 powers for each fight.</div>
